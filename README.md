### Frontend Description

1. **Framework**: React
2. **Language**: TypeScript
3. **Architecture**: Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)
   - **App**: The main entry point, setting up routes and global context.
   - **Pages**: Components for different views such as HomePage, RecipePage, and ProfilePage.
   - **Features**: Business logic components such as Authentication, Recipe Management, and Commenting.
   - **Entities**: Core entities like User, Recipe, and Comment that are used across features.
   - **Shared**: Common utilities, UI components, hooks, and styles shared across the application.

4. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS and Material-UI
   - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and custom themes.
   - Material-UI for ready-to-use components like buttons, cards, and forms.

5. **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
   - Managing global state and asynchronous actions.

6. **Key Components**:
   - **HomePage**: Displays featured recipes, popular categories, and a search bar.
   - **RecipePage**: Shows detailed recipe information, including ingredients, steps, and comments.
   - **ProfilePage**: Displays user information, their uploaded recipes, and followers.
   - **RecipeCard**: Compact display of recipe information for lists and previews.
   - **SearchBar**: Component for searching recipes by keywords and tags.
   - **CommentSection**: Component for displaying and adding comments under recipes.

### Backend Description

1. **Framework**: Express.js
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL
3. **ORM**: Sequelize for database management and operations
4. **API Endpoints**:

6. **Security and Performance**:
   - Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication.
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Optimize database queries and use caching where necessary to improve performance.

This project will leverage modern frontend and backend technologies to provide a robust, scalable, and user-friendly recipe sharing platform. The Feature-Sliced Design architecture ensures a well-organized and maintainable frontend, while Express.js and PostgreSQL provide a reliable backend solution.
